# tf2remote
Gives you the ability to add custom commands to party chat!

![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/mkLS5q8.png)

## Requirements
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

## Usage
- Add your steamID3 in `src/owner` if you want to limit command usage to yourself. (Must be in square brackets)
- Make sure TF2 has `-usercon` in its Launch Options and is running.
- Execute `run.bat` to start the program.

## Known Issues
- Isn't really an issue with this program but TF2 seems to lag when a party message gets sent/received. You can avoid it by leaving the chat open in the main menu.

More commands to come!

**Note:** The old version used to connect Discord with party chat, which is no longer possible with this version. [You can check it out here](https://github.com/bakapear/tf2remote/tree/e2985405ad02f74b0fd923225ace05eb440d8d8e)
